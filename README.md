# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns: Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project
  This analysis sought to look through a large database of data from prior crowdfunded projects to find patterns in the data to help our client best optimize their future crowfuned projects. It is our goal to come up with the best possible startagy with the data avalible to give them the greatest chance at making their project come to fruition. We used a few diffrent methods to demonstrait trends that could be used to help boost the succsess rate of their project.

## Analysis and Challenges
For my analysis of the data I made two graphs that should give useful insight into the level of funding that should be persued along with when the best times to seek funding are(see figure one and two below respectively). For the Outcomes vs Goals figure the main calcuations used to make it where done useing the COUNTIFS function. The specfifc code  I used to accoplish what I wanted was `=COUNTIFS(Kickstarter!$F:$F, "successful", Kickstarter!$D:$D, ">=1000", Kickstarter!$D:$D, "<=4999", Kickstarter!$R:$R, "plays")` which essentially says count how many successful kickstarters with funding between 1,000 and 4,999 that where in the category plays. I then used This basic code but with diffrent varibles such as "failed" or looking inbetweeen diffrent values to populate a table that could be used to calculate the percent of crowdfunded plays that where successful, failed or where cancled at diffrent ranges of funding goals. The only real road block I hit here was figuring out how to use the COUNTIFS function correctly. I did a little googling and found [https://www.ablebits.com/office-addins-blog/2014/07/10/excel-countifs-multiple-criteria/](url) which had a usefull walkthrough. I also used a tip from class to write one part of code at a time and see if it works before moving to the next part when righting it for example `=COUNTIFS(Kickstarter!$F:$F, "successful",` first before adding more to make sure it worked then adding each new indvidual part. For the Theater Outcomes vs Launch figure I first made a pivot table of our data to consolidate it all into one place. From there I graphed the data for with months created on the X axis and the number of outcomes on the Y axsis. I then filted my data to just the theater category. I personally did not have any trouble here but I could imagine that getting the graph to represent the data how you want to can be difficult and I usually have to mess around with it for a while before I get what I am looking for.

## Results
There where some intresting results from this data. First from the Theater Outcomes vs Launch(Figure1) we can see a few intresting Things. First that May is the best time to try and fund your project. The month of May had the higest number of theater crowdfunded projects be succsessful. The other big conclution we can draw is that decmber is a very bad time to try to crowdfund your project. From the Outcomes vs Goals graph(Figure2) we can conclude that if possible its best to have under $5,000 projects to get the most consistnt funding but if it is a bigger project that needs more funding you should shoot for around $40,000. I would say a very major limitation if that data set is we dont know how the crowdfunding projects where advertised. it could be the case thatall the projects that got funded where just more visable then the ones that didnt ands it wasnt necissarly that they where better projects or happened at better times, just that they had more public awarness. One table that i would add would be finding what the average donation amount for plays is and then finding the average amount of people donating to projects and using those numbers to give a rough estimate of how much money you could expect to come in or roughly how many donners you would need to get your project funded.
